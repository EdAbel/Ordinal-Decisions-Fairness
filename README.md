# Fairness and Trust in Data-Driven Decisions: Analyzing Discrepancies in Ordinal Decisions

When evaluating decisions founded on data driven procedures, it is crucial to verify that the decisions align with the procedures, to ensure fairness for those affected by the outcomes and to maintain trust. 
For decisions for which there is a set of ordinal outcomes, fairness considerations extend beyond considering parity in appropriate outcomes (true positives) across different groups. 
It is also important to consider how inappropriate outcomes (non-true positives) can result in differing consequences depending on if, and by how much, the outcome is an overestimate (falls on a higher position in the ordinal set of outcomes) or an underestimate (falls on a lower position in the ordinal set of outcomes).
